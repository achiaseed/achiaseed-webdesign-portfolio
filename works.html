              The number of people in the world struggling with anxiety is unprecedent. 
              Even I struggle with anxiety on a daily basis. Whenever I feel my anxiety rise, I try to find a safe haven
              which often is home for me to wait out the waves. 
              It has always been my desire to create a small app to help those like me calm down and 
              have that sense of "it will be okay, you're not alone, and you did well" right at their fingertips.

              I worked on the UX/UI of this group project designed for 
              D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) game masters to run their campaigns more efficiently. This entails that our users have previous knowledge
              regarding to how a campaign is run with the rules of D&D. 
              This was for my software engineering project which I collaborated with 5 other students. 
            </br>
            </br>
              Inspired by the official D&D's Player's handbook's look and feel, we wanted to evoke familiarity with our users 
             as they interacted with our program. It allows our user's experience to continually flow in game and out. 
            </br>
            </br>
              Responsibilities: generated wireframes, color schemes, font choices, general page mockups and completely 
              coded the dice roller feature (PDF of designs coming soon). 
              After clicking "View Here", simply log in to a google account and start a campaign and try out our different features.

                <div class="sga-desc center-block container">
                  This semester long project assigned during my User Interface and Design course. The goal was to 
                  create a mock program to help Biola's Student Government reach their students more effectively.
                  We worked with NetBeans and Java Swing to create a desktop program. 
                  I mostly worked on the UX/UI of the project though designs were limited due to the constraints of the program as well as user testing.
                  User testing included creating forms for our testors to give feedback, gathering testors, conducting the tests, 
                  and noting human behavior (e.g. what users struggled to identify and what users found with ease).
                </br>
                </br>
                  SGA Connect was modeled to look similar to the website Canvas which is used by students and professors to view grades, assginments, files, and syllabi.
                  Designing the layout to mimic a widely used school website allowed familiarity between student government members, their constituents (BIOLA's students), 
                  and allowed the mind to associate an application used for an aspect of school with other applications also used in school. 
                </br>
                </br>
                  I have included a sample of our program (.jar file) as well as a few of the major screens we worked on.
