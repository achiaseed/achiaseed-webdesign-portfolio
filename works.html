                        Biola University holds an annual school-wide conference, inviting speakers from all over to share their experiences 
                        from missions work and to encourage students to be bold. 
                        Due to the global pandemic, Missions Conference 2021 moved to an online virutal platform to be accessible to everyone. 
                      </br>
                      </br>
                        As the UX/UI designer of this product, my purpose was to bridge the gap of developers and designers. 
                        I ensured the designers got their ideas across and the developers could manifest those into the product.
                        My responsibilities consisted of creating the general UI of the website to pass on to our development team.
                        These neatly-designed pages allowed users to navigate the virtual conference with ease and readability. 
                        In addition, I created wireframes and mock prototypes to guide the developers in how best to achieve good user flow.
                        Each screen differed in its purpose and functionality from 
                        creating global awarness on serious topics, to playing guest speaker videos, even listing out organizations and their
                        upcoming mission trips. 
                      </br>
                      </br>
                        With the magnitude of information normally conveyed in-person, we needed to create a clean and neat design that followed
                        accessbility guidelines, while still compelling our target audience to be inspired and take action.

                      The number of people in the world struggling with anxiety today is unprecedent. 
                      Even I struggle with anxiety on a daily basis. Whenever I feel my anxiety rise, I try to find a safe haven
                      which often is home for me to wait out the troubling waves. 
                      It has always been my desire to create a small app to help those like me calm down and 
                      have that sense of "it will be okay, you're not alone, you did well, and I am proud of you"

                      Cryotherapy is a recent route of physical therapy; however, it is not well known to the public. 
                      Agency 41 created an app called <i>CryoFind</i> to help wellness centers who supply cryotherapy machines to 
                      reach a wider audience and help people live full and healthy lives. 
                      CryoFind's target audience is intended for the general public and physical therapy centers with cryogenic machines. 
                    </br>
                    </br>
                      Since the app is still in the initial creation stage, 
                      my task was to create marketing pages for <i>CryoFind</i> and
                      conduct user research on cryotherapy business owners.
                      This consisted of setting up video calls with owners and documenting their difficulties in reaching wider audiences, 
                      as well as noting what resources they found helpful. Below are a sample of wireframes I created for the app 
                      intended for the marketing website.

                      TransportOp is a program based on the research of Dr. Shieu-Hong Lin. 
                      Its purpose is to find the optimal route for drivers to take while fueling with least amount of gas to complete the journey. 
                      We used the algorithm developed by Dr. Lin to create a front-end interface and database for potential drivers; 
                      TransportOp helps drivers successfully get to their destinations, and assists gas station owners in managing their gas prices.

                    I worked on the UX/UI of Campaign Buddy, which is designed to help Dungeons and Dragons game masters 
                    organize and run their campaigns efficiently. 
                    This program was created by myself and five other students as our senior 
                    software engineering project. 
                    Our program assumes that our users understand how to operate a campaign within the rules of D&D. 
                    Our aim in designing the interface was to replicate the look and feel of 
                    the official D&D Player’s Handbook, to evoke familiarity with our 
                    users while they interact with our program. 
                    Instead of sifting through unorganized documents and breaking the flow of the game, 
                    users will be able to smoothly manage their projects with Campaign Buddy.

                      students effectively. We worked with NetBeans and Java Swing to create a desktop program. 
                      I mainly worked on the UX/UI of the project, though designs were limited due to the 
                      constraints of the program and limited user testing. User testing included creating 
                      forms for our testers to give feedback, gathering testers, and conducting the tests. 
                      It also involved observing which features were easily identified by users, and 
                      which features were more difficult to locate.

                      Canvas interface with academics, 
                      our application will evoke the same, familiar academic atmosphere in the minds of users as they navigate it.

                  The National School Project is a non-profit organization that aims to equip high school students 
                  all around the country to share God's word with their fellow classmates. I helped organize the home page layout for NSP's records website
                  which is not shown to the public but accessible by their staff. I cannot display the full version of what I worked on
                  I essentially helped organize their statistics into a more readable fashion (shown above).
